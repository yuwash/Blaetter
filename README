Blaetter is just a simple home book collector that fetches all the meta info
from worldcat. I (author: Yushin Washio) release it for GNU GPL 3 (if 
interested, go here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) so you can almost 
freely share it, edit it etc. This currently just needs python standard
library, so if you don't have python, you definitely ought to get it from
http://python.org
How to use it?: python blaetter.py
then give your bookshelf a pretty name, add some books by giving them nice
unique (this is important so that they really feel valued) name, finding their
ISBN on the back (or maybe somewhere else, who knows??), add another book etc.
them finish by writing "q" for book name.
